## Assumptions
- You have 2 my-http-server instances deployed (see the story [Life Without
  Route Registrar](../route-registrar/life-without-rr) for setup)

## Recorded values from previous stories
```
BOSH_DNS_IP=<value>
NON_BOSH_DNS_IP=<value>
```

## What
In this story you are going to add your own fun alias for your go HTTP server.

## How

üìù **Add your own alias**

1. Update your manifest to include a Bosh DNS alias (copy lines with `# < ---` and remove the `# < --- .*`). This alias could be added
   for any job on the instance group.
   ```
   instance_groups:
   - azs:
     - z1
   instances: 2
   jobs:
   - name: route_registrar
     properties: { redacted for brevity }
   release: routing
   provides:                             # < ------------ Add this block to add a Bosh DNS alias
     my_custom_link:                     # < ------------
       aliases:                          # < ------------
       - domain: "meow.meow"             # < ------------ Make the domain anything you want :D
         health_filter: "healthy"        # < ------------ Record the domain you choose as HTTP_SERVER_ALIAS
   custom_provider_definitions:          # < ------------
   - name: my_custom_link                # < ------------
     type: my_custom_link_type           # < ------------
   name: my-http-server
   # remaining yaml redacted for brevity
   ```

1. Redeploy

1. Make sure the go server is running on both of your my-http-server VMs. See
   the story [Life Without Route Registrar](../route-registrar/life-without-rr)
   for help with this step.

1. Bosh ssh onto any machine _except_ the my-http-server VM.

1. Wait a couple minutes...

1. Try to access your new URL! Success!

   ```bash
   $ curl HTTP_SERVER_ALIAS:9994

   Hello from machine with mac address 42:01:0a:00:01:16
   ```

1. Try to access your new URL from your local machine.

   ```bash
   $ curl HTTP_SERVER_ALIAS:9994

   curl: (6) Could not resolve host: meow.meow
   ```

## Expected Results

Your new alias should only be accessible within Cloud Foundry and not from your
local machine.
