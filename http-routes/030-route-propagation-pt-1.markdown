## Assumptions
- You have a OSS CF deployed
- You have one
  [proxy](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-release/tree/develop/src/example-apps/proxy)
  app pushed and called appA
- I recommend deleting all other apps

## What
The Cloud Controller API (CC API) maintains the database of all apps, domains,
routes, and route mappings.  However Cloud Controller does not keep track of
*where* those apps are deployed. Nor does CC track the IPs and ports each route
should, well, *route* to. That's the job of the router, often called GoRouter.

CC keeps track of the desired state. The user wants a route called MY_ROUTE
that sends traffic to appA.  But the user doesn't (shouldn't) care about the
logistics needed to make that route happen. That is the responsibility of other
components.

Let's look at what information Cloud Controller *does* keep track of.

## How

1. ðŸ¤” Map a route to appA. Let's call this route APP_A_ROUTE. I recommend
   _deleting_ all other routes.

1. ðŸ¤” Look at the domains, routes, destinations (route mappings), and apps via
   the Cloud Controller's API.  To look at all the domains you can curl using
   ```bash
   cf curl /v3/domains
   ```
   Use the [API docs](https://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/) to figure out the 
   endpoints for the other resources.

This is all of the information that CC contains about routes. Note there are no
IPs anywhere. Note that all of these routes are for CF apps, none of them are
for CF components.

## Expected Result
You can view data from CC about the route APP_A_ROUTE that you created.

## Recorded Values
Record the following values that you generated or discovered during this story.
```
APP_A_ROUTE=<value>
```
