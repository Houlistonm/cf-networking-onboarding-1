# What is CF Networking Onboarding?
CF Networking Onboarding is a guided exploration of the Cloud Foundry Networking
components.

[Amelia](https://github.com/ameowlia) created the first batch of the onboarding
stories in early 2019. She wanted an easy way to onboard new team members to the
Cloud Foundry Networking Team.

Though she initially built it for R&D engineers joining her team, it turned out
that there was a large demand for currated ways to learn more about the
inner-workings of Cloud Foundry. Over 75 people -including R&D engineers,
support engineers, platform architects, and project managers- have gone through
these stories as a week long class.

These stories have now been converted to this website to make the content
available to anyone.
